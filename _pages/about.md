I'm an Undergraduate student at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/) studying Computer Science and Linguistics set to graduate in December 2024. I also work as an Undergraduate Researcher as a part of the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing Lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) at UMD.

Advised by [Denis Peskoff](https://www.denis.ai), I have worked under [Jordan Boyd-Graber](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/) and [Philip Resnik](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/) on various projects in Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics.

In my free time I like to study languages and I 'speak' the following in decreasing level of fluency: English, Georgian, Russian, Spanish, Mandarin.
