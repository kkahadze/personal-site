I'm a recent graduate from the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/) with degrees in both Computer Science and Linguistics. I am currently exploring job opportunities and graduate schools.

Advised by [Denis Peskoff](https://www.denis.ai), I have worked under [Jordan Boyd-Graber](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/) and [Philip Resnik](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/) on various projects in Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics.

In my free time I like to study languages and I 'speak' the following in decreasing level of fluency: English, Georgian, Russian, Spanish, Mandarin.
