I'm an Undergraduate student at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/) studying Computer Science and Linguistics set to graduate in December 2024. I also work as an Undergraduate Researcher as a part of the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing Lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) at UMD.

Advised by [Denis Peskoff](https://www.denis.ai), I have worked under [Jordan Boyd-Graber](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/) and [Philip Resnik](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/) on various projects in Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics.

In my free time I like to study languages and I 'speak' the following in decreasing level of fluency: English, Georgian, Russian, Spanish, Mandarin.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
